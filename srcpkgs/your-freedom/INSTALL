  == IMPORTANT NOTICE ==

  This package will help you identify nonfree packages that are installed
  on your system at the time of its installation, as well as protecting
  you from (accidentally) installing them.

  Also, if any other nonfree package is identified, later updates will ask
  you for its removal.

  Have in mind that, if you want to retain certain nonfree packages
  installed on your system, you'll have to remove your-freedom :)

  If you find out any of the following:
  * Cascade package removal due to nonfree dependencies,
  * Your-freedom conflicting with a libre package,
  * Etc.

  Please report back to the project on the usual channels:
  * https://github.com/drake-newell/void-packages/issues
