# Set this below to yes to allow some packages that have minor issues
# (like branding, suggesting optional dependencies etc.). But it should
# be used with caution because if you're not careful, some nonfree
# packages may come through.
_allow_semifree=no

# Set this below to yes to allow some packages listed on allowlist.txt.
# allowlist.txt should list each package name that should be allowed on each
# line. In case some package is already libre on default repo and should be
# indicated, enter the package name twice adding a ":" between them. If you
# change the file, remember to clear cache according to the note below in the
# comment.
_use_allowlist=yes

# Set this below to yes to enable denying packages listed on denylist.txt.
# Packages listed on that file will be added to the conflicts list. Useful for
# packages not listed on Parabola's blacklist.txt but present on Void. List
# each package name on each line of that file.
_use_denylist=yes


# Note 1: This package is still under testing. It is inspired by the Parabola's
# your-freedom package. However, libretools is not explored yet.

# Note 2: If you are building this package locally and have built it in the
# past it is a good idea to clean cache to remove any history of it's conflict
# data from past versions:
#   $ rm hostdir/binpkgs/{*-repodata,your-freedom-*.xbps}


# Commands outside functions run multiple times.
# Setting $conflicts once does not work (it forgets it next time).
# There is no way to determine which run will set the conflict correctly.
# This is a workaround to set it when the $conflicts is found as being empty.
