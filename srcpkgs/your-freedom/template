# Commands outside functions run multiple times.
# Setting $conflicts once does not work (it forgets it next time).
# There is no way to determine which run will set the conflict correctly.
# This is a workaround to set it when the $conflicts is found as being empty.
# The "curl" condition only runs it when it finds curl (could be inside or
# outside build environment) to avoid error.
# The "host" condition is to run it when it's ready to build.
# Combined with the curl condition, it makes sure it runs after "installing
# host dependencies" step.
